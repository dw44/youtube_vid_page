Replica of the Youtube video page.


Project Specification: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/embedding-images-and-video


The purpose of the exercise is to practice HTML and CSS skills, and only to mimic the layout of the page, not the functionality. As such, many of the elements on a standard Youtube page that would link to other pages are substituted with images that either link to the page itself or do not link to anything at all. 


Usage of div and section might be a little arbitrary. Still working on HTML5 semantic tags.


The aim is not to make an exact replica but to ensure all the multimedia elements are included, and in roughly the right place.
